Metadynamics is a powerful enhanced molecular
dynamics sampling method that accelerates simulations by
adding history-dependent multidimensional Gaussians along
selective collective variables (CVs). In practice, choosing a
small number of slow CVs remains challenging due to the
inherent high dimensionality of biophysical systems. Here we
show that time-structure based independent component
analysis (tICA), a recent advance in Markov state model
literature, can be used to identify a set of variationally optimal
slow coordinates for use as CVs for Metadynamics. We show
that linear and nonlinear tICA-Metadynamics can complement existing MD studies by explicitly sampling the systemâ€™s slowest
modes and can even drive transitions along the slowest modes even when no such transitions are observed in unbiased
simulations.
